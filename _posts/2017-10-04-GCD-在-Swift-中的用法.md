### The impact of adverse weather on bikesharing usage in peak hours.
As shown in my figure below, most of the docking stations not significantly affected by any adverse weather factors (stations denoted by blue dots) are located in the areas where the bike usage is pretty high. These areas are considered to be densely populated and equipped with various municipal facilities. Most bike trips in such areas are usually work-based or mandatory and thus naturally less affected by weather. On the contrary, the docking stations located in other areas seems to be more sensitive to adverse weather effects and bike-sharing trips generating in such stations are more discretionary.
